# Change Log

## [1.0.0-alpha7] - 2016-10-27
### Fixed
- Removed entries from the webpack config looking for
  `node_modules/gatsby/node_modules`. This was added to help when
developing Gatsby using `npm link` but when Gatsby is installed
regularly, it then fails the Webpack validation as
`node_modules/gatsby/node_modules` doesn't now exist.

## [1.0.0-alpha6] - 2016-10-27

### Fixed
- Use babel-traverse instead of using babel-plugin so that don't say
  done early when running graphql queries that have async resolvers

## [1.0.0-alpha4] - 2016-10-07
### Added
- Add more file extensions to file/url loader config. Default to url

  run code at the very start of client app.

- Actually use the "sources" key from gatsby-config.js for looking for
