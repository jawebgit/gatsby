title: Plugin & Theme Tutorials
---

Gatsby plugins are Node.js packages that implement Gatsby APIs and are commonly installed through a registry like npm. Plugins are a way to encapsulate, re-use, and compose Gatsby functionality. A good example of this concept are Gatsby themes which is a type of plugin that includes a `gatsby-config.js` file and adds pre-configured functionality, data sourcing, and/or UI code to Gatsby sites.

> You can refer to the [conceptual guide on plugins,theme,and starters](/docs/plugins-themes-and-starters/) for more information.

In this section, you'll find tutorials for:

1. Setting up a site using a single theme (the blog theme)
2. Setting up a site which composes multiple themes (the blog theme, and the notes theme)

To learn more about themes in general, you may be interested to check out the [themes section of the docs](/docs/themes), as well.
