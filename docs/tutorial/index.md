title: Gatsby.js Tutorial
---

Weâ€™re so happy you decided to try using Gatsby. This tutorial has five parts that'll walk you from getting started developing and building Gatsby sites to deploying a finished and polished high performance static PWA.

Note: If you prefer a quick start rather than step-by-step tutorial, see the [getting started page](/docs/).

This tutorial is for *everyone*! You do not need to be a programmer or React.js expert. We'll walk you through things.

0. [Programming basics](/tutorial/part-zero/): If you are new to programming, go here for an introduction to some basics like terminal,  code editors, and browser consoles.
1. [Introduction to Gatsby basics](/tutorial/part-one/) - Starting new projects, developing, and deploying sites.
2. [Introduction to using CSS in Gatsby](/tutorial/part-two/): Explore libraries like Typography.js and CSS Modules.
3. [Building nested layouts in Gatsby](/tutorial/part-three/). Layouts are sections of your site that are reused across multiple pages like headers and footers.
4. [Learn how to query data with GraphQL](/tutorial/part-four/). Explore source & transformer plugins. Get introduced to programmatic pages and how to write GraphQL queries. In this part of the tutorial we'll build a bare-bones markdown blog.
