title: Theme Composition

When building themes, it's often worthwhile to consider how your theme can compose with others. In some cases you might want to break your theme into modular parts, like `gatsby-theme-blog` and `gatsby-theme-ecommerce`.

Since themes are still early, we recommend getting started by building themes that are more monolithic. It's less overhead to get started and a theme can always be broken up into smaller themes later.
