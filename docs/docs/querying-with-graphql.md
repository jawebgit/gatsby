title: Querying with GraphQL

# What is GraphQL?

graphql.org describes it as "...a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data".

Gatsby uses GraphQL to create a consistent interface between your static site and your data sources, where data sources can be anything from local markdown files to a remote API.

Gatsby describes your data by creating GraphQL _schemas_ from your data sources.

GraphQL _queries_ can then be associated with your Gatsby pages, ensuring each page receives exactly the data it needs.


# Why GraphQL?

* As Gatsby runs on both server (at build time) & client,
need way to specify which data is needed.
* This is a *build-time only* use of GraphQL. You don't need to run a
GraphQL server in production.
* Convenient way to describe data requirements of component.
* Why query colocation rocks
* Uses the Relay Modern compiler behind the scenes

# Basic Terminology

* Types based on file type + way data can be transformed
* Connections
* Shallow intro to how data layer works e.g. source and transformer plugins.
* Compare to webpack loaders — like loaders except create schema that
can then be queried.
* Named queries?
* Using query parameters to manipulate results?

# Example queries

Showing off sorting, filtering, picking fields, programmatic transformations

[Some example queries from Gatsby's tests](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/52e36b9994a86fc473cd2f966ab6b6f87ee8eedb/packages/gatsby/src/schema/__tests__/infer-graphql-input-type-test.js#L116-L432) - look for \`template literal blocks\` with `allNode{}` in them.
