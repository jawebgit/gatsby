## Install build environment

To be able to run Gatsby and especially sharp (a dependency to have a powerful image processor), you need to have a functional build environment (Python and Visual C++ Build Tools).

The easy way to have this build env on windows is to run `npm install --global windows-build-tools` on an admin powershell console.
