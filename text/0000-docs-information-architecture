# Summary

A proposal to add a second (maybe even third) level of navigation to the docs on gatsbyjs.org and to add new top-level categories.

# Motivation

Through many user research interviews, I've heard that it's difficult for people to find what they are looking for in the docs. They have mentioned many instances where the information they are looking for does not exist, it exists but they couldn't find it, or it exists and they could find it in multiple places (not in one single place). This is likely because the docs have outgrown their current categories.
This design also proposes a possibly heuristic for determining what we can reasonably commit to maintaining as part of Gatsby core docs, and what might be too far outside the scope of core docs (either because the topics don't fit or because they are not a priority, given our limited time and resources). includes a list of what will *not* be included in Gatsby core docs.

# Detailed design

MVP
- [ ] add a second (possibly third) level to docs navigation in the sidebar in accordion style menu, e.g. how do we make the sidebar not too long or overwhelming?
Expand top (and potentially second-level) navigation items that do not belong to the current section on user interaction (see e.g. https://reactjs.org/, https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js for second-level)
- [ ] Selected state for sidebar items
    - Maybe the current “bullet point” doesn’t work very well for indented navigation items
    - The current purple doesn’t stand out enough
    - The use of the “bold” Futura may cause the navigation item text to take one more line than the default “normal” Futura state, causing the navigation items below to change their position
    - Digital Ocean does cool selected state and hover state stuff: https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/v2/#authentication
- [ ] create new categories of docs. When clicked, the only thing that happens is that sub-items become visible and the active page remains the same as it was before clicking the category name until a sub-item is clicked. So essentially, clicking on a sub-item is the only way to see a new active page.
- [ ] create stub articles for the ones we don’t have yet

Nice to have:
- [ ] publish templates for each category of docs to facilitate contributions and contract work
- [ ] mobile menu that you can access w/o scrolling to bottom of screen (see Flo’s notes below on Reactjs.com’s mobile version vs. Stripe’s docs which ignore small screens)
    - Currently https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ is the only way on Mobile to access the Desktop sidebar content
    - https://reactjs.org/ is an excellent example of a Mobile navigation for our sidebar content, but the button position conflicts with our current mobile navigation
    - Noteworthy: the equally excellent https://stripe.com/docs/quickstart and https://stripe.com/docs/api completely ignore smaller screens
- [ ] Way to copy and paste code easily 
- [ ] Sidebar collapsed view
    - Make the sidebar togglable so that people who are distracted by the persistent display of the sidebar on large screens can hide it on demand (fk: I’d label this “nice to have” clearly, even if this goes hand-in-hand with the implementation of the Mobile navigation)

Possible future enhancements:
- [ ] API on top level nav
- [ ] versions of the docs
- [ ] Way to test APIs. Ask devs for their favorite ones. 
- [ ] automatically pull in doc prereqs at top of each page (see https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/transactions.html as a great example of how to design this. Not sure how to code it)
- [ ] doc accessibility/design options (changing font type and size or screen and font colors, what about language?)

Here is a possible restructure of the current docs information architecture (with the inclusion of many docs we still need to write):

What we may not need to include in the docs:
- Starters and the Awesome Gatsby stuff will appear in a starter library and a site showcase, so will no longer need to be in docs fairly soon.
- Integration tutorials and guides (such as Gatsby + Netlify, Gatsby + Contentful). 
    - Reasons to exclude these from docs: imho, we don't have the time to maintain the potentially infinite number of tutorials this could include. Also, perhaps we don't want to show preference for any company over another? Do we just make sure all the plugin READme files are really high quality?
    - Reasons to still include them in docs or somewhere else (like a blog): tons and tons of people would use them.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- I'm not sure what the code complexity of changing the URL structure of pages includes
- The side bar might be able to remain the same size or structure. Not sure.
- Could this break links people have to current docs?


# Alternatives

I'm not aware of any other designs we've considered. Anyone? The potential benefits of doing this outweight the negatives, imho. Especially because docs are only going to keep growing. The current hierarchy doesn't allow for much more growth.

# Adoption strategy

I don't think this would be hard for people to adopt, hopefully.

# How we teach this

If it's really good information architecture, it won't need to be taught ;). We would redesign it if we find that we have to explain it to people. We could write an initial blogpost with a tour of the docs structure for those who want to understand the change and see an overview, and then this overview could be included in an intro to the docs.

# Unresolved questions

- Number of levels of hierarchy. I want to keep it to 3 at the most. Suggestions or reasons to only do 2, or to do more, like 4?
- How to handle change in all the URLs
