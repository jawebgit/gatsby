# Summary

Our command-line interface (CLI) is OK but not great. It will be useful to generate a set of design principles to base the CLI around — but not change what's working well (which is a lot of it). So let’s do it!

The CLI is the main entry point and interface people have (currently) for Gatsby. Everyone sees it! So it has a huge influence on people’s experience of Gatsby.

We’re going to create a CLI style guide and then implement that style guide, which includes redesigning error messages, introducing `gatsby --quiet` as a default mode and make more extensive use of `gatsby --verbose` flag. To make the CLI easier to design and improve, we’ll implement Ink. To optimize the CLI design, we’ll use the data being collected through our telemetry setup, which collects data about CLI usage (opt out is possible).

# Basic example

Note: [Ink](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ink), an npm package that gives us the use of React for CLIs, will make it easier to design the CLI with consistency. Just as React helps web UIs have a consistent design, Ink will provide the same thing for our CLI.

# Motivation
## Why are we doing this?
We have found many areas where the Gatsby CLI is doing well and many other areas where it is lacking. Here are resources that informed our knowledge of problems that Gatsby CLI has and possible ways to solve those problems:
- [Evaluation of other CLI tools](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/12951)
- [Nielsen Norman Group 10 usability heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
- [Nielsen Norman Group error message design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/error-message-guidelines/)
- [Heroku CLI style guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cli-style-guide)
- [12 Factor CLI Apps](https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46)
- [User journey through the Gatsby CLI](https://whimsical.co/2PxMcRGE63bwk1Ayc3emAB) (informed by usability interviews and the Gatsby core team’s observations of what issues are most common regarding the CLI)

## What use cases does it support? 
Developers who use the Gatsby CLI to start, develop, and build Gatsby sites.

## What is the expected outcome?
The expected outcome is that the Gatsby CLI will adhere to common sense usability and accessibility standards and will also help people start, develop, and build Gatsby sites faster and with less frustration.

Here are the “user can” statements we want to be true after this redesign:
Contributors and Ink team members can decide which changes to merge or not through usability heuristics and style principles
Users can know what an error is and how to solve it
Users can know the current state of the system
Users can know when they need to take action and how to take that action

## Data collection outcomes
See this [RFC on Error surveying & improvement](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/rfcs/pull/37)

## Objectives
- Increase the rate of adoption - more Gatsby CLI users!
- Make sure users can reach their goals through the CLI
- CLI should embody the principles in the CLI style guide

## Anti-goals
- Losing Gatsby users
- Creating frustration or making tasks take more time

# Detailed design
We’d like to create a [CLI style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rv7tBUeqHN4t_UecuEAKVCWAVzQoCmcDoONBmf3HggI/edit?usp=sharing) and implement its principles.
We'd also like to make the changes outlined in the section titled below, called "List of top action items"
A related RFC is the [Error surveying & improvement RFC](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/rfcs/pull/37)

## List of first hypotheses to test
- [ ]  If we clear the Gatsby CLI screen to only display success messages or error messages, people will save time in finding the right thing
- [ ]  If people use a Gatsby CLI quiet mode, people will find and fix errors faster (quiet mode would make errors more discoverable)
- [ ] If the Gatsby CLI suggests the correct spellings for misspelled Gatsby commands, people will save time and be happier. For example, when people need help, we could make it more easily discoverable so they don’t have to type multiple commands (e.g. `gatsby --help` then `gatsby build  --help`). Possible solution: provide help information for a variety of inputs `gatsby h`, `gatsby`, `gatsby help`, etc. and update our did-you-mean file to dogfood the correct commands
- [ ] If we prevent the same error message over and over again, people will be less confused and fix the error faster
- [ ] Including createPages page count in output can help users optimize for speed and catch errors faster
- [x] When people type the wrong thing in the browser (e.g. “localhost:8000/_ _ graphiql), we could either redirect to "correct" one or just support multiple different cases. This will help them spend less time looking for the right link.
- [ ] Make sure that links to development site / graphiql are easily discoverable, which will also help make sure users can find the links without much scrolling. The problem is that errors / recompiling notices are getting appended endlessly so users need to scroll very far sometimes to get to those links. Possible solutions: If we would clear older errors / notices so the links are few lines away would fix it as well. Another option is for `gatsby develop` to be interactive (like `jest --watch`) where you can use commands while it's running and we could have a command to open the browser with development site / graphiql as part of the available commands. With Ink we can make sure we don't add too much info at the bottom.
- [ ] Offering suggestions for those who want to customize CLI commands, such as `gd` for `gatsby develop` could help people stick with gatsby because they can customize it, make it theirs, and get stuff done faster.
- [ ] If we shorten the effort needed to input a starter URL into the `gatsby new` command, people will be happy because it’s easier. One idea is to link to starter library or give options of starter in the CLI. See WIP at https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/14097
Shortening the input needed is nice: you can take away the https://www before the starter name and it still worked
- [ ] Only show stack traces for _user_ errors—we often now show stack traces for e.g. babel parsing which isn't relevant to the user
- [ ] If we implement a new format for common errors, with page, line:column, error description, a suggestion of how to resolve the error, and invitation “if you’re unable to resolve this error, here’s how to file an issue. Here are forums in Discord and Spectrum where you can chat with other Gatsby users.” People will be able to resolve errors faster and we’ll get fewer issues on Github about those errors.
- [ ] Consider a new “job to be done” = user wants to speed up their build times. Helping them identify where things are slowing down helps them reach their goal. "It’d be nice to get more context on what certain output means so that if I have a long-running build, I can target where things are slowing down"
- [ ] If we garbage collect and warn for certain situations, e.g. “we just got rid of every single node of this type,” the user can determine if that action was correct and may find the root cause of some errors that are hard to trace 
- [ ] Ctrl+c & `gatsby develop` → notify ppl they might need to hit `r` if they’ve changed package.json, gatsby node, etc.
- [ ] Peer dependency warnings - how to let ppl know they can ignore them - track thru telemetry
- [ ] If developing a local plugin, offer to restart & clear cache so it’ll take effect




Things to keep doing well:
- `gatsby new [project-name]` is easy!
- Keep develop and build output easy to find
- Keep a list of all CLI information on docs site because it’s one click and searchable there


There will be many more proposed changes based on the CLI style guide.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- Implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- Whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space
- The impact on teaching people Gatsby
- Integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- Cost of migrating existing Gatsby applications (is it a breaking change?)

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

We’ve considered many designs, and will do testing throughout implementation to make sure these changes improve the user experience of Gatsby users. 

If we don’t do this, things will still be ok; we’ll just miss out on becoming a more helpful CLI.

# Adoption strategy

Existing Gatsby developers will enjoy the benefits of this redesign without doing much work; when they update Gatsby, we can notify them that `gatsby --quiet` is their new default, and they can learn of any new flag in `gatsby --help`. Most other changes will be embedded in the flow they’re already used to.

# How we teach this
We teach this through the CLI style guide and an updated CLI document, which we’ll need to publish in the docs.

# Unresolved questions
We don't know for sure which changes will definitely help solve problems in the CLI. We'll need to gather data and test our hypotheses. We can get a lot of value from implementing the RFC on Error surveying & improvements. Other data collected from telemetry will help us optimize the CLI experience.
