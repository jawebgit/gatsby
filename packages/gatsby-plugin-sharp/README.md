# gatsby-plugin-sharp

Exposes several image processing functions built on the [Sharp image
processing library](https://github.com/lovell/sharp). This is a
low-level helper plugin generally used by other Gatsby plugins.  You
generally shouldn't be using this directly but might find it helpful if
doing very custom image processing.

## Install

`npm install --save gatsby-plugin-sharp`

## How to use

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
]
```
